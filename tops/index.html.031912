<h1>KFJC Gumball Tally</h1>

<p>Let it be said, that if something got one play in a week at KFJC,
chances are that was the <b>MOST</b> important play of the week.
Still some people like looking at numbers till they go numb, so
below you can find the tops of our pops...the joys of our noise.

<p>Even though there are not enough hours in a week to play all the
music we want, don't let that stop you folks from sending us more
vital life blood. Discs with grooves or discs with laser pits are
always welcome at
