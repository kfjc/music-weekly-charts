<h1>KFJC Gumball Tally</h1>

<p>Let it be said, that if something got one play in a week at KFJC,
chances are that was the <b>MOST</b> important play of the week.
Still some people like looking at numbers till they go numb, so
below you can find the tops of our pops...the joys of our noise.

<p>And while I'm soliloquizing, who are you... come closer and
stop that incessant shaking. You cannot be an underpaid intern
from some mega-distro meat music market. 

<p>Could it be you are an artist yourself, one who gets the
undefinable vibe of KFJC? If so, send us your vinyl, your
CDs, your cassettes
